<h2>Background</h2>

Over the past 2-3 years, inflation, rising interest rates, and the post-covid boom has caused THD to see price fluctuations which have the potential to influence sales and customer preference. A major issue at hand is that current sales forecasting models implemented by the team have high error rates related to specific KPIs such as Daily Sales, Gross Demand, etc.

Since we will be dealing with the raw data, our problem involves looking at a snapshot of the top 100K products. In terms of customers, departments, and vendors involved: this will involve a large amount of data and a large number of customers, all 13 departments are involved including those of Appliances, Kitchen & Bath, Millwork, Hardware, etc, and no vendors are involved.

<h2>Approach</h2>

We first plan to begin with background research into the company, markets, and industry. To start working with the data we will need to conduct exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing. We then will dive into our data modeling stage. Once we start getting results, we must synthesize and summarize. As we continue to build our model, we will continuously iterate to improve our model and find better results. Finally, we will deliver our final presentation and results.
