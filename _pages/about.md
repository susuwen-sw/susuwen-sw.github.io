I am a MEng student in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) with Data Analytics concentration. I graduated from Tongji Univeristy, major in Data science in 2023.

I am also a practitioner by applying what I learned to provide business solutions and hope to use my skills to gain business insights. I have experience in designing data warehouse models for big tech company facing with billion-level data and also have worked in electric vehicle industry to gather data, build models and design dashboard for R&D engineering analysis. These experiences all exposed me to a business setting while using technical skills combined with data to solve problems.

Aside from enhancing my technical skills, I gradually become a quick learner and a team player. This helps me to adapt to a new environment more quickly and find a position in the team to take initiatives and make impacts.
